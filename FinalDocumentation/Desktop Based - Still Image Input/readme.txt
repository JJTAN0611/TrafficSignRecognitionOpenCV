1. Copy the traffic sign dataset images and place into the "Input Dataset" folder

2. You may specify the path of the images to be classified by editing the "testInputs.txt". The correct way to specify the path is, e.g. "InputDataset/abc.png" if the image you wish to classify is abc.png

3. Ensure that the trained SVM and Random Forest model are inside the folder "Models/NoStd/"

RF Model Name - "T6G1_rtree.xml"
SVM Model Name - "T6G1_SVM.xml"

4. Afterwards you may launch the Traffic Sign Recognizer.exe
